# Optimal Stopping Task Experiment

When given a series of airplane tickets, which may be seen in order, how will people choose which ticket to buy if once you have gone past one ticket you cannot go back and choose it? 

A study, conducted using this website, attempted to answer that question.

The results were published in the follow paper:
