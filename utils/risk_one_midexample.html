    <b>Now we proceed to the real trials</b>. Again, consider you're at the casino. You will do a series of games of the same choice that you have trained before: <br> either you choose the fixed reward, or you spin the wheel and receive the reward shown on the wheel.<br>
		Remember that the values shown on the pie chart are changing.<br><br>
		Your bonus will be calculated by selecting the outcome of <b>one random game</b> from the upcoming games, and rewarding you the same number of cents as dollars in the outcome. For example, if the randomly chosen outcome was $180, you will earn $1.80.
