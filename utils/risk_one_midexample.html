    <b>Now we proceed the real trials</b>. Again, consider you're at the casino. You will do a series of trials of the following choice: either option 1, which will give you a fixed reward, or option 2, which will give you one of a set of rewards, with probabilities as shown in the pie chart. Your reward will be calculated by selecting the outcome of <b>one random trial</b> from the upcoming trials, and rewarding you the same number of cents as dollars in the outcome. For example, if the randomly chosen outcome was $180, you will earn $1.80.
