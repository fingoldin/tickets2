				<i>Purpose of the research:</i> To examine the way people make sequential decisions.

				<br><br>
				<i>Risks:</i> 30 minutes

				<b>Benefits:</b> This study provides no benefits to you individually. The study provides important information about the nature of learning and decision making. This has potential implications for public domains, such as healthcare policy and the justice system, where understanding the processes governing choice (e.g., of insurance, medical care, illegal substances) can lead to more psychologically effective public policy.
