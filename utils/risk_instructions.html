    Let's imagine that you are at the casino.
		Your goal is to win as much money as possible.<br>
    You will be presented with several sets of gambles. Each set will have a fixed number of gambles, and you will have the chance to go through each gamble sequentially. At the end of each gamble in a set, you will be asked if you want to accept that gamble's result. If you do, you will progress to the next set and will not be able to see any of the remaining gambles in the set. Alternatively, on each gamble (except the last in the set) you can choose to skip to the next gamble. <br>NOTE: skipping a gamble means you won't be able to go back to it again.<br><br>
		Let's do a trial run to see how it works.
