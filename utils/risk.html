        First of all, consider you are buying an airplane ticket. You have 2 options: you can either buy it for $180 (Option 1), or take your chance on a roulette wheel that will either give you a $140 or $220 ticket (Option 2). If you choose the second option, you have a 50/50 chance of getting either $140 or $220, but you must pay the ticket you get.
