        At this stage, we ask you to make a choice between the following two options. Consider yourself buying another airplane ticket, except this time you can either buy it for $180 (Option 1), or take your chance on a roulette wheel that will either give you a $140 or $200 ticket (Option 2). If you choose the second option, you have a 50/50 chance of getting either $140 or $200, but you must pay the ticket you get.
