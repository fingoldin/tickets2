      In the next part, you will be presented with three blocks of sequences, where the number of tickets in each sequence in a block
      will be the same. Thus, the next phase is exactly the same as the ticket sequences you saw earlier. But, there will be no example or training trials, so all your choices after this moment will count towards your bonus.
