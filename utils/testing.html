		In this section you will encounter many sequences of tickets, one ticket after the other. The goal is to find the cheapest ticket from each sequence.
		For every ticket you can either buy it or decide to look at the next one. However, you cannot go back to a ticket that you already saw.
		<br><br>
		You will get a monetary bonus that depends on your performance in these next trials.	<br>
		The closer your chosen ticket price is to the cheapest ticket price in the sequence the more money you will receive.	<br>
		If you choose the cheapest ticket price in every sequence, you will earn the maximum bonus of $2.00.
		<br><br>
		Pressing the spacebar will go to the next price, or will choose the current one if it is the last in the sequence.
		<br><br>
		NOTE: The two following sequences are example sequences, and while you should try to find the best price, your performance on these sequences does NOT matter regarding your final payement.
