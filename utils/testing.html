		In this section you will encounter many sequences of tickets, one ticket after the other. The goal is to find the cheapest ticket from each sequence. Each sequence will have 10 tickets.
		For every ticket you can either buy it or decide to look at the next one. However, you cannot go back to a ticket that you already saw.
		<br><br>
		Pressing the spacebar will go to the next price, or will choose the current one if it is the last in the sequence.
		<br><br>
		NOTE: The first couple following sequences are example sequences, and while you should try to find the best price, your performance in these sequences does NOT matter regarding your final payement.
