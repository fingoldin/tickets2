		In this section you will encounter a sequence of 10 tickets, one ticket after the other. The goal is to find the cheapest ticket from this sequence.
		For every ticket you can either buy it or decide to look at the next one. However, you cannot go back to a ticket that you already saw.
		<br><br>
		Pressing the spacebar will go to the next price, or will choose the current one if it is the last in the sequence.
		<br><br>
		NOTE: The following sequence is an example sequence, and while you should try to find the best price, your performance in this sequence does NOT matter.
