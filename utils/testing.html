		Now your task is to go from one scrapyard to the other to sell your car. This will be done in 50 repeated trials.
		<br>In each trial you can visit up to ten scrapyards. Each trials starts with an offer which you can accept or decline.
		<b>If you decline you go on to the next offer and there is no turning back.</b> <br>
		The trial ends if you accept a price, or if you arrive at the 10th offer, then the final price is logged, and a new trial starts from the beginning.<br>
   The range of prices you can expect to see at each scrapyard is identical to that you just learned, and your goal is to find the highest offer in each trial. <br><br>
	 Your final bonus payment depends on your decisions. The closer your accepted prices are to the best prices in a sequence of offers the more money you will receive. The possible earning in a trial is revealed after you made your choice, and in the end of the study, one trial is randomly seleceted and payed out to you as a bonus.
		<br><br>
		Let’s have a look at an example sequence of offers.<br><br>
		NOTE: The following example does NOT YET matter regarding your final payment.<br>
		To decline a price you can either hit the „Continue“ button or the spacebar, and you will go to the next price. <br>
		If you hit the „Sell“ button you accept the price and the trial ends.
