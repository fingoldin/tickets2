		In this section you will encounter sequences of price offers for your broken car, identical to the prices you experienced in the training phase.<br>
		For every price you can either accept it or decide to continue to the next one. <br>
		However, <b>if you decline an offer from a particular scrapyard you cannot go back and sell it there anymore</b>.<br>
		The goal is to find the highest offer in the sequence.
		<br><br>
		Pressing the spacebar will go to the next price, or will choose the current one if it is the last in the sequence.
		<br><br>
		NOTE: The first following sequence is an example sequence, and while you should try to find the best price, your performance in this sequence does NOT matter regarding your final payment.
