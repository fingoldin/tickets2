		In this section you will encounter many sequences of stock prices. For each sequence, the goal is to find the <b>highest selling price</b>.
		For every selling price you can either buy it or decide to look at the next one. However, you cannot go back to a selling price that you already saw.
		<br><br>
		Pressing the spacebar will go to the next price, or will choose the current one if it is the last in the sequence.
		<br><br>
		NOTE: The first following sequence is an example sequence, and while you should try to find the best price, your performance in this sequence does NOT matter regarding your final payment.
