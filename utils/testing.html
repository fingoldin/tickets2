		In this section you will encounter many sequences of stocks, one stock after the other. The goal is to find the <b>most expensive</b> stock from each sequence. Each sequence will have 10 stocks.
		For every stock you can either buy it or decide to look at the next one. However, you cannot go back to a stock that you already saw.
		<br><br>
		Pressing the spacebar will go to the next price, or will choose the current one if it is the last in the sequence.
		<br><br>
		NOTE: The first following sequence is an example sequence, and while you should try to find the best price, your performance in this sequence does NOT matter regarding your final payment.
