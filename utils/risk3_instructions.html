    Now let's imagine that you are at the casino and you have to decide whether you want to play a gamble.
		Your goal is to win as much money as possible.<br>
		In the gamble, you either choose a fixed amount of money or you decide to a spin a wheel of fortune with the hope of winning a higher amount of money.	<br>
		PLEASE NOTE: The values from the spinner will be changing from trial to trial, which you will be able to see graphically on the spinner's pie chart.	<br>
		Let's do a trial run to see how it works.
