You will be presented with a spinner, which you can spin up to ten times, exactly as you did before. <br>
Each time you spin it, you can either accept the result as a reward, or spin the spinner again in hopes of a higher reward.<br>
Your bonus will be calculated by selecting the outcome of one random trial from the upcoming trials,
and rewarding you according to your performance: <br>
The closer your outcome is to the highest outcome in this trial the more money you will receive.	<br>
