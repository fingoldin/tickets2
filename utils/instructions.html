				Imagine you want to buy an airplane ticket for a trip to Vancouver. Different airlines offer
				different deals for your trip but you want to find the cheapest ticket from all the offers.
				<br>
				And thatâ€™s exactly what you will be doing here.
				<br><br>
				The first task is divided into four parts:
				<br><br>
        <b>1. Training phase</b>
        <br>
          You will encounter 60 potential ticket prices for your first trip and we than check how
          well you have learned these ticket prices. If you do well enough you can continue to the test phase,
          otherwise you will encounter 60 more ticket prices.
                       		<br><br>
				<b>2. Test phase</b>
				<br>
				You will choose a ticket out of a sequence of 10 tickets that are presented one after the other.
        The goal is to find the cheapest ticket. You will be shown 80 of these sequences.
        <br><br>
        <b>3. Training phase</b>
        <br>
          Now you plan a different trip and again you will see 60 potential ticket prices for this second trip.
                       		<br><br>
				<b>4. Test phase</b>
				<br>
				You will choose again a ticket out of a sequence of 10 tickets that are presented one after the other.
        The goal is to find the cheapest ticket for this new trip. You will be shown again 80 of these sequences.

        <br><br>
                Please press continue to begin.
<!--				<b>Training phase 2 </b>
				<br>
          This time you plan to fly to Mexico City and you encounter slightly different ticket prices.
          In this section you will see again 50 ticket prices for your new trip.
				<br><br>
        <b>Test phase 2 </b>
        <br>
			  Find again the cheapest ticket out of 10 tickets.
				<br><br>
				This study lasts at most 30 minutes and you will get $2.00 for participating. Further,
				you will get a bonus depending on your performance up to a maximum of $4.00.
				<br><br>
				You will get detailed instructions and a trial run during the study.
				<br><br>
				Please press continue to begin.
