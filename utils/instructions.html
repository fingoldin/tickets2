		<div class="cscroller">
                       	<p>
				Imagine you want to buy an airplane ticket for a trip to Canada. Different airlines offer
				different deals for your trip but you want to find the cheapest ticket from all the offers.
				<br>
				And thatâ€™s exactly what you will be doing here.
				<br><br>
				The experiment is divided into four parts:
				<br><br>
        <b>Training phase 1 </b>
        <br>
          We will show you 50 potential ticket prices for your trip.
                       		<br><br>
				<b>Test phase 1 </b>
				<br>
				You will choose a ticket out of 10 airplane tickets that are presented one after the other.
        The goal is to find the cheapest ticket.
				<br><br>
				<b>Training phase 2 </b>
				<br>
          This time you plan to fly to Mexico City and you encounter slightly different ticket prices.
          In this section you will see again 50 ticket prices for your new trip.
				<br><br>
        <b>Test phase 2 </b>
        <br>
			  Find again the cheapest ticket out of 10 tickets.
				<br><br>
				This study lasts at most 30 minutes and you will get $2.00 for participating. Further,
				you will get a bonus depending on your performance up to a maximum of $4.00.
				<br><br>
				You will get detailed instructions and a trial run during the study.
