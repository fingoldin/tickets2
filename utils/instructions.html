				Imagine you want to purchase a product online. Digital prices are fluctuating over time but your
			  goal is to find the cheapest price.
				<br><br>
				And thatâ€™s exactly what you will be doing here. Let's explain:
        <br><br>
        You will encounter different products and your task is to purchase each product at its best price.
        For each product you will be encountering 10 prices one after the other and for every price you can either buy the product at this price or decide to look at the next one.
        However, you cannot go back to a price that you already saw.
        Once you have reached the 10th price (the last one in the sequence) you are forced to purchase the product at this price.
        <br><br>
        In order to get familiar with the task, we start with a test trial.
        <br><br>
        NOTE: This test trial is an example trial, and while you should try to find the best price for the product, your performance in this sequence does NOT matter regarding your final payement.

<!--				<b>Training phase 2 </b>
				<br>
          This time you plan to fly to Mexico City and you encounter slightly different ticket prices.
          In this section you will see again 50 ticket prices for your new trip.
				<br><br>
        <b>Test phase 2 </b>
        <br>
			  Find again the cheapest ticket out of 10 tickets.
				<br><br>
				This study lasts at most 30 minutes and you will get $2.00 for participating. Further,
				you will get a bonus depending on your performance up to a maximum of $4.00.
				<br><br>
				You will get detailed instructions and a trial run during the study.
