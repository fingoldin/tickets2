		In the next section you will encounter 60 products of 10 prices each.
		The goal is to find the best offer in every sequence of prices, just as in the trial sequence.<br>
		<br>
		You will get a monetary bonus that depends on your performance in these next trials.	<br>
		The closer your chosen price is to the cheapest offer in the sequence the more money you will receive.	<br>
		If you choose the cheapest product price in every sequence, you will earn the maximum bonus of $4.00.
		<br><br>
		Note: You can press the spacebar to go to the next price in each sequence during this phase.
