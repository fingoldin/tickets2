		In the next section you will encounter 120 products of 10 prices each.
		The goal is to find the best price for each product, just as in the trial sequence.<br>
		<br>
		You will get a monetary bonus that depends on your performance in these next trials.	<br>
		The closer your chosen price is to the cheapest price for this product the more money you will receive.	<br>
		If you choose the cheapest product price in every trial, you will earn the maximum bonus of $4.00.
