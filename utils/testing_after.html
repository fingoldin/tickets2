		Let's start!
		<br><br>
		In the next section you will encounter 50 consecutive sequences, each of 10 ticket prices, just as you saw before.
		The goal is to find the best ticket in every sequence.<br>
		<br>
		You will get a monetary bonus that depends on your performance in these next 50 trials:
		<ul style="margin:8px 0px">
			<li><b>3 points</b> for picking the <b>cheapest ticket</b></li>
			<li><b>2 points</b> for picking the <b>second cheapest ticket</b></li>
			<li><b>1 point</b> for picking the <b>third, forth or fifth cheapest ticket</b></li>
			<li><b>0 points</b> otherwise</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		Your overall bonus will be proportional to your points, e.g. if you win all the points (300 points) you get $4.00, if you get half the points (150 points) you get $2.00.
		<br><br>
		Note: You can press the spacebar to go to the next ticket or sequence of tickets during this phase.
