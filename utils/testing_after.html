		In the next section you will encounter 50 sets of 10 stocks.
		The goal is to find the highest price stock in every sequence, just as in the example sequence.<br>
		<br>
		You will get a monetary bonus that depends on your performance in these next trials.	<br>
		The closer your chosen stock is to the cheapest stock in the sequence the more money you will receive.	<br>
		If you choose the most expensive stock in every sequence, you will earn the maximum bonus of $2.00.

		Note: You can press the spacebar to go to the next stock in each sequence during this phase.
