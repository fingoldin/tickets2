		Let's start!

		In the next section you will encounter 200 consecutive sequences, each of 10 ticket prices, just as you saw before.
		The goal is to find the best ticket in every sequence.<br>
		<br>
		You will get a monetary bonus that depends on your performance in these next 200 trials.	<br>
		The closer your chosen ticket is to the cheapest ticket in the sequence the more money you will receive.	<br>
		If you choose the cheapest ticket in every sequence, you get the maximum overall bonus of $4.00.
		<br><br>
		Note: You can press the spacebar to go to the next ticket or sequence of tickets during this phase.
