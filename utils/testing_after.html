		In the next section you will encounter 50 sequences of 10 price offers for your broken car.
		The goal is to find the highest selling price in every sequence, just as in the example sequence.<br>
		<br>
		Your bonus will be calculated by selecting the outcome of one random sequence from the upcoming sequences,
		and rewarding you according to your performance: <br>
		The closer your chosen price is to the highest price in this sequence the more money you will receive.	<br>
		<br><br>
		Note: You can press the spacebar to go to the next selling price in each sequence during this phase.
