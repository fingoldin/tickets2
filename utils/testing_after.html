		In the next section you will encounter 50 sequences of 10 price offers for your broken car.
		The goal is to find the highest selling price in every sequence, just as in the example sequence.<br>
		<br>
		You will get a monetary bonus that depends on your performance in these next trials.	<br>
		The closer your chosen price is to the highest price in the sequence the more money you will receive.	<br>
		If you choose the highest price in every sequence, you will earn the maximum bonus of $2.00.
		<br><br>
		Note: You can press the spacebar to go to the next selling price in each sequence during this phase.
