		In the next section you will encounter 100 sets of 10 tickets, just as you saw before.
		The goal is to find the best ticket in every sequence.<br>
		<br>
		You will get a monetary bonus that depends on your performance in these next trials.	<br>
		The closer your chosen ticket is to the cheapest ticket in the sequence the more money you will receive.	<br>
		If you choose the cheapest ticket in every sequence, you earn a bonus of $2.00.
